# Setting up Jupyter Notebooks on Your Own Machine

## Without the terminal/command line

For everyone not yet comfy with installing things via text based access to the OS I recommend getting Jupyter Notebooks via Anaconda.

To do this go to link:https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual[Anaconda for Individuals]

Then Download the installer-

Once you have the Anaconda interface running click the Jupyter Notebook button. If its not already installed click install. If it is installed click launch.

Jupyter will now launch.

It should open at your home directory. From here you have the open to create a new notebook, folder, moving through your computers directory.
